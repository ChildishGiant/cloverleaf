# [Perdola](https://childishgiant.github.io/perdola/)

See the [latest patch notes here](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/perdola/commit/master).

A smart solution to the problem of passwords. Perdola generates passwords on demand, using the name of the app you're making a password for and a master password.

### How the versioning works
All versions will take the form of XYZ

**X** is the **major version** number. This is for feature updates. An example of one of this
kind of update would be introducing the "presets" feature. Major features are defined as updates that change the way one uses the service. The number will take the form of A.B. EG: 1.0 or 0.1

**Y** is the **patch** number. This is for content updates / minor features. An example
of this would be adding more presets.

**Z** is for number for **bug fixes**.

So Version 1.456 would be the 14th major update (We started at Version 0.00),
the 5th patch and the 6th bug fix for that patch.


###To-do:

* Add a tutorial (Maybe guided using [intro.js](https://introjs.com/))
* Add #presets so that if one visited https://childishgiant.github.io/perdola#potato the word "potato" would be input as a password automatically
* Add tumblr/yahoo preset (Warning system to say that they use the same account.)
* Implement custom char sets to most presets

### Tools used for development

Github's [atom.io](https://atom.io/) is my text editor of choice.

All minimization is done using [Prepros](https://prepros.io).
