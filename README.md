# [Perdola](https://childishgiant.github.io/perdola/)

See the [latest patch notes here](https://github.com/ChildishGiant/perdola/commit/master).

A smart solution to the problem of passwords. Perdola generates passwords on demand, using the name of the app you're making a password for and a master password.

### How the versioning works
All versions will take the form of XYZ

**X** is the **major version** number. This is for feature updates. An example of one of this
kind of update would be introducing the "presets" feature. Major features are defined as  It'll take the form
of A.B. EG: 1.0 or 0.1

**Y** is the **patch** number. This is for content updates / minor features. An example
of this would be adding more presets.

**Z** is for number for **bug fixes**.

So Version 1.45 would be the 1st major update (We started at Version 0.00),
the 4th patch and the 5 bug fix for that patch.
