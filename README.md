# [Perdola](https://solarpolarman.github.io/perdola/)

Perdola is on Version 0.12. See the [latest patch notes here](https://github.com/SolarPolarMan/perdola/commits/master).


A smart solution to the problem of passwords. Perdola generates passwords on demand, using the name of the app you're making a password for and a master password.

There is a very large feature in the works to make Perdola as simple as possible to use, while still generating strong passwords. This will be added in Version 0.2.

All minimization is done using [Prepros](https://prepros.io).

Idea stolen from [Master Password](http://masterpasswordapp.com/).
