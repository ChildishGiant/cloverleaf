# [Perdola](https://solarpolarman.github.io/perdola/)

Perdola is on Version 0.2. See the [latest patch notes here](https://github.com/SolarPolarMan/perdola/commits/master).

A smart solution to the problem of passwords. Perdola generates passwords on demand, using the name of the app you're making a password for and a master password.

All minimization is done using [Prepros](https://prepros.io).

Thanks to [RealFaviconGenerator](http://realfavicongenerator.net) for making a glorious website for making favicons easy.

Idea stolen from [Master Password](http://masterpasswordapp.com/).
