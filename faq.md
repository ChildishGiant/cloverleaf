**Q:** What is this and why should I use it?:

**A:** This is a complete redesign of the traditional password generator/storage system. Instead of relying on a hard drive to not to fail, or that backup you keep forgetting to make, Perdola makes a password based on your master password and the application you want a password for. This generated password will be the same every time, no matter what device you're on. You can then copy this and paste it into the app you want to log into.



**Q:** How do I know you're not looking at my passwords?:

**A:** When you hit submit, your computer takes the app name and your master password and using them makes a new password. Nothing is ever sent across the internet, other than the code for the website itself. If you really want, you can [download the files](https://github.com/SolarPolarMan/perdola) for the website, smash your router and run Perdola offline (Not that I'd recommend smashing your router.)

If you want to be sure I'm not phishing for passwords or anything like that, you can read through all the [code on github](https://github.com/SolarPolarMan/perdola).
